## About
This is a minimal addon template for Mavi.as runtime that it use to initialize a new addon to extend AngelScript abilities using C++. Please note that this project cannot be built without Mavi.as as it contains intended invalid syntax. The directory named _make_ can be used as build directory used by CMake otherwise can be deleted.

## Next steps
After you get and initialized git repository for this addon, Mavi can **optionally** be added as submodule dependency:
```bash
# Execute on initialized repository.
    git submodule add {{BUILDER_MAVI_URL}} deps/mavi
```
